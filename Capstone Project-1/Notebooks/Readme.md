ðŸ“Œ Project Overview (Pointwise)

Cleaned raw dataset by handling missing values, fixing datatypes, and removing duplicates.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, patterns, and correlations.
Built visualizations (charts, graphs, heatmaps) to highlight key insights and findings.
Organized the workflow into three Jupyter notebooks:
01_data_cleaning.ipynb â†’ Data preprocessing
02_exploratory_analysis.ipynb â†’ EDA & summary statistics
03_visualizations.ipynb â†’ Visual insights & conclusions
Tools & Libraries used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Goal: Transform raw data into actionable insights through a structured analytics pipeline.
