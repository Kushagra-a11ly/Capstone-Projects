Employee Attrition Dataset

ðŸ“Œ Objective
This dataset is designed to explore the factors that contribute to employee attrition. It helps address questions such as:
How does travel frequency impact retention across departments?
Does monthly income differ by education level when comparing employees who stay versus those who leave?
The dataset is synthetic (created by IBM data scientists) and mimics real-world HR data patterns.
