Employee Attrition Dataset
📌 Objective

This dataset is designed to analyze and uncover the factors influencing employee attrition. It helps answer key workforce questions such as:
How does commute distance vary by job role among employees who stay versus those who leave?
What is the relationship between education level and average monthly salary when comparing attrition groups?
The dataset is synthetic (not real employee data) and was generated by IBM researchers to resemble real-world HR scenarios.

📂 Dataset Description

Each row represents an employee’s profile with demographic, work-related, and satisfaction attributes. The target variable indicates whether the employee has left the company (attrition) or stayed.
