📊 Customer Shopping Behaviour – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, industry-style data analytics workflow. It includes loading and cleaning a dataset in Python, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), executing SQL queries for business insights, creating visual dashboards in Power BI, and preparing a final report and presentation.
The goal is to understand customer shopping behaviour and derive insights that support real-world business decisions.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains customer demographics, purchase behaviour, product preferences, transaction details, and engagement metrics.
It is used across:

Python (Cleaning + EDA)
SQL (Insight Generation)
Power BI (Dashboard Visualisation)
🛠 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
Power BI (Interactive dashboarding)
Gamma (Auto-generated PPT report)
GitHub (Version control & documentation)

🧵 Steps Followed

1️⃣ Load & Clean Data (Python)
Imported dataset using Pandas
Handled missing values and duplicates
Standardised column formats
Created new calculated fields for analysis

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Studied distributions, trends, and patterns
Analyzed demographics, product categories, and seasonality
Created visualizations for behaviour and performance insights

3️⃣ SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)

Loaded cleaned dataset into SQL database
Performed joins, aggregations, and segmentation queries
Identified high-value customers, top categories, and revenue drivers
Extracted business insights using SQL logic

4️⃣ Power BI Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard with slicers and KPIs

Added visuals for sales trends, demographics, loyalty behaviour, and product analysis
