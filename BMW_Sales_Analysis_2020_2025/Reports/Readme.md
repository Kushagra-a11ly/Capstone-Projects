Reports

This folder contains all reports, summaries, and documentation generated during the data analytics project.

 Folder Structure
- Exploratory Analysis Reports
  Contains initial findings from the dataset (trends, missing values, distributions, etc.).

- Visualization Exports
  Screenshots, plots, and dashboards exported from the notebooks.

- Final Reports  
  Cleaned and formatted reports (PDF, Word, PPT, or Markdown) for presentation and sharing.

 Naming Convention
- Use clear and consistent names for files. Example:
  - `EDA_Report_Jan2025.pdf`
  - `Sales_Analysis_Summary.md`
  - `Visualization_Customer_Trends.png`
  - `Final_Report_Presentation.pptx`

## Guidelines
1. Keep raw analysis in the Notebook folder, and only export key results here.
2. Use the **Visualizations** folder for charts/plots and reference them in the report if needed.
3. Ensure the final report includes:
   - Problem statement
   - Data description
   - Analysis approach
   - Key insights & trends
   - Recommendations or conclusions
